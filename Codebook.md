#Codebook for Getting and Cleaning Data
=======================================

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

#There are 2 output files:
File: TidyCombinedData.txt (the combined data extracted from the original data set)
File: TidyAverageData.txt (The combined data set aggregated to show the mean of each column grouped by activityName and subject ID)

#Data columns:
activityId: ID of the activity performed
activityName: Name of the activity performed: WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
subjectID: ID of the subject performing the activity

The following are measurements of the means and standard deviations extracted from the original data.
(For the TidyAverageData, this column is the mean of the measurements grouped by ActivityName and subjectId)
